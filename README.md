# Capstone_Project_Regression_Yes_Bank_Stock_Closing_Price_Prediction_Nitin
Conclusion
In conclusion, our project aimed to develop a predictive model for forecasting Yes Bank's stock prices. We explored various machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, analyzing their performance before and after hyperparameter tuning. After thorough evaluation, we found that the Linear Regression model performed the best, providing the most accurate predictions. This model can be valuable for investors and stakeholders in making informed decisions about Yes Bank's stock investments. However, it's essential to continuously monitor and update the model to adapt to changing market conditions and improve its accuracy over time. Overall, our project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting stock prices and supporting investment strategies.
